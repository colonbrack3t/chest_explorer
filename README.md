# chest_explorer
A coding challenge to find the holy grail! It will traverse across countless JSON files to find the holy grail, countless dubloons, dead spiders and boots sizes!

## How to run
The usual Python setup. I have included a requirements file, however the only package required is "requests"

`pip install requests` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`

`python chest_explorer.py`
